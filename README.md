## Viz + Survey
- Lumley's book ch 4: graph methods for survey package

    - Ok for plot with summaries (bars, boxplots, etc)    
    - Challenge: scatter plot,mention some options 

- Lumley2017-regression, Korn88 
    - bubble plot with size acording wt  
    - plot resampled data, resampling using prob propto wt
    - use wts as alpha value
    -  hexbin with hexarea proportional to wt

- Which option is better? better for what? 

No clear comparison among options, some comments on alppha or ressampled are more suitable with large n. 

Maybe: room for perfom a comparison with lineup. Is one of the options better for estimate population correlation ?
